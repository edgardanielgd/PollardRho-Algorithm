# Pollard's Rho algorithm applied to Elliptic Curves Encryption

Pollard's Rho method is a known strategy to break certain algorithm that rely on the Discrete Logarithm Problem. By means of this project we will be able to test how powerful is it against a simulated communication environment between two hosts that use ECC within communication process.
